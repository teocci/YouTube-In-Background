# How to install YiB (APK file) on your Android Phone

Android app package files commonly known as an APK (`.apk`) files are the format of installable files on Android platform. Every application you have installed or want to install on your Android device has the .apk extension or file format.
You can install applications from the Google Play Store but there are also methods that let you install applications directly on your Android device without having to install any application Market. 

In the Android world, directly installing an APK is also called **“sideloading”**. There are numerous reasons why you should know about installing `apk` files. Not all manufacturers support Google Play Store on their Android devices, in that case you have to install apps via sideloading.
There are also times when Google Play will not let you install an app due to region restrictions or it won’t even display the app in your region, which again makes sideloading a necessity. In order to successfully sideload an app or install an apk file, you must follow some really simple steps.
