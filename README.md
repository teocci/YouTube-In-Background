# YouTube-In-Background

YTinBG is an Android app, which plays only audio in background.

This feature is against YouTube terms of service and could not be present on Google Play Store; therefore, I have developed it just for personal purposes. 

YTinBG provides mechanisms for searching videos and playlists on YT, as well as logging into a Google account in order to acquire private playlists, which normally cannot be accessed.
